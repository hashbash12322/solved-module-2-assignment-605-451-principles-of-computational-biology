<strong>Small Project 1 </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Find the best local alignment between the following two sequences using two ways:

  <ol>

   <li>Manually calculate scores on the DP table, draw the path, and write out the two aligned sub sequences. (50 points)</li>

   <li>Write a computer program in Java or any other programming languages to compute the local alignment score and print out the aligned two sub sequences. (50 points)</li>

  </ol></li>

Linear gap model:

Gap = -4

Match = 5

Mismatch = -4







What to turn in

<ul>

 <li>Turn in DP table with the scores and paths</li>

 <li>Turn in the two aligned sub sequences</li>

 <li>Turn in your source code</li>
